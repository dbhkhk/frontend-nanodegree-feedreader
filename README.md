# Feed Reader Testing

This is a project from [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com)'s [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and started writing the first test suite. I wrote another 2 specs(tests) in the original suite and 3 new suites with 5 specs(tests), two of which involving asynchronous functions.
